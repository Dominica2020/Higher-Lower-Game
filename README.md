# Project 14 for 100 Days of Code Bootcamp
- Used python to code a Higher Lower game
- Incorporated some ASCII art
- Imported game data from a list of dictionaries
- User must guess who has the most followers between A & B
- If the user guesses wrong, the game ends showing the user's final score
- If the user guesses correctly, their score increases by 1 & "Compare A" now becomes the celebrity that was previously displayed as "Against B"

# TO DO LIST
- Generate random "Compare A" + "Against B"
    - print name, description, country
- Compare follower count
- Track score
- If guess correct:
    - increase score
    - A now becomes B
- If guess wrong:
    - quit came & display final score
